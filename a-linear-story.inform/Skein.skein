Death
Emerging from the Revelation, the journey finished, you take a deep breath. A seemingly endless labyrinth of thinking. A pattern only broken by Death itself. 

You think you see a gnarled old redwood tree out here.

 It didn't have to be this way. Maybe you can retrace your steps.

Round and round we go again. Your cyclical thoughts float around the room, taunting you. You did start spiraling from some type of idea, but it seems there you have no logic here. Is this healthy? To stay here, thinking the same thought over and over, unable to break the pattern?

It seems that you have come to a conclusion here again. You found your Big Idea!

Revelation
It seems ages since you came to your last conclusion. You had a big idea, but not sure where it ran off to. You can end it here, embracing the eternal slumber. You remembered spiraling down there earlier. Do you remember what you were feeling so anxious about?

You ruminated for a moment.

Time passes.

Spiraling
Round and round we go again. Your cyclical thought patterns are doing no good here. You did stem from some type of thinking, but it seems there you have no logic here. Is this healthy? To stay here, thinking the same thought over and over, unable to break the pattern?

Maybe there is a revelation soon if you wait awhile.

You think about how Death finally got you, but it seems you came to Death first.

Choice
This or that. You have options. 

You need to decide to continue. 

Your parents made a choice too, a choice in naming you. When you emerged from birth you were set for something. Was your name a blessing or a curse?

What's the big idea? It seems ages since you came to your last conclusion. You can end it here. Or you can go back to the spiral.

Spiraling
Round and round we go again. Your cyclical thoughts float around the room, taunting you. You did start spiraling from some type of idea, but it seems there you have no logic here. Is this healthy? To stay here, thinking the same thought over and over, unable to break the pattern?

Maybe there is a revelation soon if you wait awhile.

You hit the flow, entering a thoughtful space. Maybe if you looked into an idea you might be able to find something. You can linger on the decision you had made.

Thoughts
You hit the flow, entering a thoughtful space. Maybe if you looked into an idea you might be able to find something. You can linger on the decision you had made. 

 You don't know if the choice was optional, something thrust upon you. You might end up spiraling, ruminating on the choices that you made. The choices that plague your mind.

An idea floats around.
